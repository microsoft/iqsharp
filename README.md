# Microsoft Quantum Development Kit: IQ# Kernel #

Welcome to the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit!

This repository contains the IQ# kernel for the [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/).
This kernel provides Q# support for the Jupyter platform, as well as the backend used by the Python client for Q#.

- **[Jupyter/](./tree/master/Jupyter/)**: Assembly used to interoperate between Jupyter and the rest of the IQ# kernel.
- **[Src/](./tree/master/Src/)**: Core of the IQ# kernel.
- **[Tests/](./tree/master/Tests/)**: Unit tests for IQ#.
- **[Tool/](./tree/master/Tool/)**: .NET Core Global Tool used to install and launch IQ#.
- **[Web/](./tree/master/Web/)**: Provides a RESTful API into IQ#.

## New to Quantum? ##

See the [introduction to quantum computing](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/concepts/) provided with the Quantum Development Kit.

## Getting Started ##

The Jupyter kernel provided in this repository is built using [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/) (2.2 or later) and the compiler infrastructure provided with the [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/).
Please see the [getting started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide) for how to get up and running.

You may also visit the [**microsoft/quantum**](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum) repository, which offers a wide variety
of samples on how to use this kernel to run Q# in Jupyter Notebooks, or from Python.

### Building IQ# from Source ###

To build IQ# from Visual Studio 2017 or later, please use the [`iqsharp.sln`](./blob/master/iqsharp.sln) solution file.
To build using the .NET Core SDK, please run `dotnet build iqsharp.sln`.

In either case, the IQ# kernel can be installed by using `dotnet run`:

```
cd src/Tool/
dotnet run -- install
```

Optionally, you can install IQ# in _development mode_, which instructs the Jupyter platform to rebuild IQ# whenever a new kernel is started:

```
cd src/Tool/
dotnet run -- install --develop
```

This can cause some issues, especially when running multiple instances of IQ#, such that we recommend against using development mode in general usage.

### Telemetry ###

By default, IQ# collects information about the runtime performance of IQ#.
To opt-out of sending telemetry, create an environment variable called IQSHARP_TELEMETRY_OPT_OUT set to a value of 1 before starting IQ#.
The telemetry we collect falls under the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).
